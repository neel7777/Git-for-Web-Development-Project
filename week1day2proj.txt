    Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    inline elements may only contain data or other inline elements, so block elements cant go inside.
    inline elements also do not force a line break in document flow while block elements do.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Computed position is fixed, element is removed  from the normal document flow, and no space is created
    for the element in the page layout. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
     
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
